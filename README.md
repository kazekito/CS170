Authors: \<[Jessie Lu](https://github.com/Jess-say)\> \<[Bao Lam Le](https://github.com/kazekito)\> 

## Project Description
We are going to solve the 8 puzzle problem using 3 different algorithms:
  * Uniform Cost Search
  * A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic
  * A* with the Euclidean Distance heuristic
  
Uniform Cost Search chooses the cheapest node, g(n), to expand and h(n) is hardcoded to 0. 
A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic will also choose the cheapest node, g(n), to expand. However, g(n) in this case would be the number of misplaced tiles in the puzzle. 
A* with the Euclidean Distance heuristic will choose the node that also has the cheapest node. The g(n) in this heuristic would be found by using the pythagorean theorem.

## Start the program
Using the terminal you would first need to type in `g++ -o <program name> main.cpp`
Then type in the command `./program_name.exe`
Note: Program name is not what you need to type in. You must type in the program name that you have named it

## Using the program
Once the terminal is opened you will see the starting message.

Follow the instructions and type 1 for the default puzzle or 2 to enter your own. Then hit enter. Depending on what choice you enter different options should pop up.

If you typed in 1. You should get the following message.

If you typed in 2. You should get the following message and type in your puzzle following the same outline as below.

Now it is time to choose your algorithm. As you can see from the picture above when you type in option 1. When you hit enter after choosing your algorithm the code should start running to find the solution. All that's left is to wait for the end. If there is a solution and the code is able to find it then there should be an output that displays the solution.
